    "A group of statistica techniques that test the dofference of means between groups. ANOVA testing is useful when is wanted to test a hypothesis about group differences based on ctegorical independent variables. The intuition begind ANOVA is to compare the variability BETWEEN different groupswith the variability WITHIN the groups. If they are comparable, then the differences between groups are more likely to be due to sampling variability. The variation between and within groups is calculated as sums of squares, which are then expressed as a ratio. The ratio is known as the F-statistic.\n",

    "Analysis of covariance is a blend of ANOVA and regression. I is a statistica technique used to compare the means of different groups while controlling for the effects of one or more contiuous covariates. In other words compares a response variable by both a factor and a continuous independent variable. ANCOVA ises regression to adjust the depndent variable based on the covariates. This adjustment helps to isolate the effect of the independent variable, the grouping factor, on the response.  \n",

    "The first step in ANCOVA is to adjust the depndent variable by removing the influence of the covariates. This is done using a regression model. Then performs an ANOVA on the adjusted dependent variable. This step tests whether the group means are different, accounting for the covariates.\n",
